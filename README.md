# babble-note

A conversational note app.

Right now its just a surprising amount of code for a hello world. It is a electron app
loading a native node module built in Rust using Neon.

# What is this architecture? Why did you make these choices!

My choices were mostly educational rather than technical. I recently read the rust book and wanted an excuse to use it. I also want to develop my JS skills.

I did some googling and found this [neat article](https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/) so I thought I would try it.
